    This box will always fit fully in the browser window. See how it fits when you make the window really short and wide, vs how it fits when you make the window narrow and tall. But this is just an interesting trick. The real power of vw's is in being able to make fonts scale. Notice how the wrapping on this text never changes, regardless of how big or small you make the window. That is the promise of vw's, to be able to lay the page out once and have it look the same across any browser width, across your entire breakpoint. You will never have to deal with wrapping issues again!

  <h1>But if you really want to deal with wrapping issues, you can set a min and/or max on the scaling.</h1>
